    The following report summarizes every non-closed MAP where you are listed as either a <em>Responsible Auditor</em> on the Finding or a <em>Reviewer</em> on the Action Plan.
    While all these MAPs may not be currently in your queue, you should be tracking them to make sure they get reviewed and closed timely, especially if you're the <em>Responsible Auditor</em>
    on the Finding
